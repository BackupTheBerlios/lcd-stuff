Description
-----------

lcd-stuff is a client for lcdproc written in C.


Features
--------

    * display of e-mail using POP3, IMAP and local mailboxes
    * MPD control
    * display of news items using RSS
    * display of the weather from weather.com
    * play web radio with MPlayer
      (because it has support for almost every format, especially
      RealAudio, which MPD hasn't)


Requirements
------------

    * 20×4 display
    * lcdproc, of course
    * CMake
    * C compiler
    * glib
    * mail
      - libetpan
    * weather
      - nxml
      - curl (required by nxml)
    * mpd
      - libmpd (>= 0.12.0)
    * rss
      - mrss
      - nxml
      - curl (required by nxml)
    * mplayer (optional, only at runtime)


Installation
------------

    * mkdir build
    * cd build
    * cmake ..
    * make
    * make install

If you don't have all libraries installed and you don't need the features, you
can use following parameters for the cmake run to disable the libraries and
their corresponding features:

   -DBUILD_RSS=OFF              disables rss
   -DBUILD_WEATHER=OFF          disables weather
   -DBUILD_MAIL=OFF             disables mail
   -DBUILD_MPD=OFF              disables mpd


Usage
-----

Just as every lcdproc client. Type "lcd-stuff -h" for more information. An
example configuration file is supplied with lcd-stuff (lcd-stuff.conf). The
documentation for all the various parameters is contained below.


Keys
----

mail, rss:      Up and Down select previous or next item

mpd:            Up: when playing (i.e. not pause), selects the next tile
                    when pausing, then stops playback
                Down: toggles between play and pause

mplayer:        Up: toggle between play and pause
                Down: Stop


Remote Interface
----------------

This program itself has a remote interface to be controlled from another
computer. See the [network] entry of the configuration file below. By default,
the network interface is disabled for security reasons!

The only client that implements the interface is the mplayer client.

It's a simple text protocol:

    mplayer command args

And command can be one of:

    streams                 Returns a list of stream names, the same as
                            shown in the menu.
    play <number>           Plays stream <number>. Counting starts with 0.
    pause_play              Toggles playback and pause of the current stream.
    stop                    Stops playing the current stream.

In the scripts directory of the source distribution, there's a sample client
written in Python that implements these commands. It's both meant as usable
client and as example.


Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file is in a INI-style format. As parser, the glib2
"Key-value file parser" is used which is documented at
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-Key-value-file-parser.html.

In the description below, following place holders are used

    <str>                   A simple text which may contain spaces. There's
                            _no_ need to escape spaces with backslash or
                            something else.
    <no>                    A continuous number, starting with 0 and increased
                            each time. You'll see below the sense of this
                            <no> stuff.
    <int>                   A number in decimal representation.
    <list>                  Not any arbitrary string but a string from a list
                            that is listed in the description on the right.
    <bool>                  "true" or "false"

Now, the options for each client are explained. It's legal to leave out a client
in the configuration file which means that this client doesn't get displayed.

                            Not required when using mailboxes.

                            in the search box, click on the city. Then you
                            can extract the code from the URL. For example,
                            GMXX0096 stands for Nürnberg in Germany.

    unit=<str>              Switches between metric units like Celsius
                            ("metric") and imperial units like Fahrenheit

                            if you select a station from the lcdproc menu.
                            Default: Webradio

    <str>=<str>             For each stream, a key value pair with station=url
                            must be used. This should save typing instead of the
                            scheme which is used for E-Mail and RSS feeds [1].
                            If the URL is a play list, then the prefix
                            "playlist " has to be used. This is simply because
                            mplayer cannot determine if it's a playlist
                            automatically but the starter has to give the
                            "-playlist" parameter.
                            Examples:
                            DLF=http://dradio-ogg.t-bn.de/dlf_high.ogg
                            Bayern2=playlist ...
                                    ...http://www.br-online.de/streaming/...
                                    ...bayern2radio/bayern2radio_m20.red.smil


    [network]

    Adding this entry without any key/values enables the network interface.
    By default, the network interface is disabled.

    DON'T USE THIS OPTION IF YOUR COMPUTER IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE
    INTERNET. IT'S DESIGNED FOR SMALL HOME NETWORKS ONLY!

    port=<int>              The port where a remote client can connect to.
                            Default: 12454
