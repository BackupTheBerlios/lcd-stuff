Usage
-----

Just as every lcdproc client. Type "lcd-stuff -h" for more information. An 
example configuration file is supplied with lcd-stuff (lcd-stuff.conf). The
documentation for all the various parameters is contained below.


Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file is in a INI-style format. As parser, the glib2
"Key-value file parser" is used which is documented at
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-Key-value-file-parser.html.

In the description below, following place holders are used

    <str>                   A simple text which may contain spaces. There's
                            _no_ need to escape spaces with backslash or
                            something else.
    <no>                    A continuous number, starting with 0 and increased
                            each time. You'll see below the sense of this
                            <no> stuff.
    <int>                   A number in decimal representation.
    <list>                  Not any arbitrary string but a string from a list
                            that is listed in the description on the right.
    <bool>                  "true" or "false"

Now, the options for each client are explained. It's legal to leave out a client
in the configuration file which means that this client doesn't get displayed.
